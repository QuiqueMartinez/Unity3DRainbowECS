# Unity3DRainbowECS
Simple study of Unity3D ECS.

Bare example of Unity's ECS usage. Consists of a cube containing by default 60x60x60 water dropplets.
According to the light source direction and the camera position, every dropplet will show a color. 
The contribution of all of these dropplets is seen by the observer as a rainbow.

Testing: 20 fps (216000 instances) on a I7-4770 @3.40 Geforce1080 Gtx
Unity Version: 2020.3.4f1
